# Advanced Analysis & Assembly Language

![assembly](assets/img/assembly101.png)

**Advanced analysis**

Advanced analysis has two complementary parts: static and dynamic. What separates advanced from basic analysis is the depth and the methods used to inspect a binary.


**Advanced static analysis**

In advanced static analysis we examine the compiled program without running it. For Windows Portable Executables this means looking at the assembly (ASM) produced by the compiler. Because authors rarely provide source code, we load the packaged executable into decompilers and disassemblers to reconstruct readable code and recover the program's logical flow. The goal is to extract how the program was written and how it will execute, by reading assembly, cross-references, imports, and embedded data.

**Advanced dynamic analysis**

Advanced dynamic analysis means running the binary under a debugger so we can control and observe execution at the instruction level. A debugger gives precise control over every instruction: set breakpoints, step through code, inspect registers and memory, and watch how runtime state is constructed. This lets us see unpacking, decryption, dynamic imports, and other behaviors that only appear while the program runs.

**What is assembly?**

Assembly is a low-level, human-readable representation of the CPU's instructions. High-level source code (C, C++, Python, etc.) is translated by a compiler into machine code — patterns of bits and bytes the CPU executes. Assembly sits one level above those bit patterns and uses mnemonics like mov, test, and jne to represent operations (for example: mov eax, edx; test eax, eax; jne 0x401000). It is more cryptic than high-level code but far more informative about what the CPU will actually do.

**Key idea: abstraction**

Abstraction moves us from bits to instructions to human-language constructs. Programmers write in high-level languages for readability. Compilers lower that code into machine instructions; assembly exposes those instructions so we can reason about behavior on the bare metal.

**Next: lab**

We'll move into the lab to load a Windows PE, examine its assembly in a disassembler/decompiler, and trace its execution under a debugger to reconcile static findings with runtime behavior.

## Advanced Static Analysis Lab: Dropper Sample (`malware.unknown.exe.mals`)

In this lab, we revisit the dropper sample from earlier in the course to perform advanced static analysis using a disassembler/decompiler. The goal is to understand the program's logic, API usage, and control flow at the assembly level.

**Tool:** Cutter 

Cutter is a free, open-source, Qt-based graphical frontend for low-level reverse-engineering frameworks (radare2/rizin). It packages disassembly, graph view, a built-in decompiler, hex/strings viewers, and debugging integration into a single GUI. Cutter makes it easier to explore functions, follow control flow, inspect cross-references, and run light interactive debugging — which is why it's ideal for this advanced static/dynamic analysis lab.

### 1. Opening the Sample in Cutter

- Launch Cutter and open the sample (`dropper.downloadfromurl.exe.mals`).
- Keep analysis enabled and use the default (auto/AAA) analysis level.
- The dashboard provides basic info: architecture, hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256), and more.

### 2. Exploring Functions and Entry Point

- In the left panel, review the list of all functions detected in the binary.
- Double-click the entry point to view the program's starting instructions.
- You'll see raw assembly code—this is the closest view to what the CPU executes.

### 3. Understanding Program Execution

- Every program has a `main` function, the central hub from which execution flows.
- Use Cutter to locate and open the `main` function.
- Look for familiar strings (e.g., `C:\Users\Public\Documents\CR433101.dat.exe`)—these often reveal file paths or indicators used by the malware.

### 4. Visualizing Logic with the Graph View

- Switch to the **Graph** tab to see a visual representation of the program's logic flow.
- The graph shows how instructions branch and connect, making it easier to follow conditional logic and function calls.

### 5. Key Findings: API Calls and Logic

- The binary contains a hardcoded URL (e.g., `ssl-6582datamanager.helpdeskbros.local/favicon.ico`).
- The program calls the Windows API function `URLDownloadToFileW` to download a file from this URL.
- The result of this API call is stored in the `EAX` register (the extended accumulator).
- The program tests the value of `EAX`:
  - If the download succeeds, it proceeds to execute the downloaded file.
  - If the download fails, it triggers self-deletion logic and removes itself from disk.
- This logic is visible in the graph as conditional jumps (e.g., `jne` instructions) between code blocks.

### 6. Decompiler View

- The **Decompiler** tab attempts to reconstruct high-level source code from the assembly.
- Here, you can see the API call (`URLDownloadToFileW`) and its parameters, making the program's intent clearer.
- Look for other familiar strings and function calls from your earlier static/dynamic analysis.

### 7. Analyst Tips

- Use the graph and decompiler views to trace the main logic: network access, file writing, and self-deletion.
- Try to find all the indicators (URLs, file paths, API calls) you identified in basic analysis.
- Practice following the flow from the entry point through the main function and into key API calls.



This approach demonstrates how advanced static analysis tools like Cutter help you move from raw assembly to a high-level understanding of malware behavior, bridging the gap between static indicators and real program logic.



## Recognizing Patterns in x86 Assembly

As you work more with assembly, you'll start to recognize common patterns and instructions. Here are the foundational concepts and instructions you'll encounter in x86 binaries:

### 1. Core Components of Execution

- **CPU Instructions:** The actual operations the CPU performs (arithmetic, data movement, control flow).
- **Memory Registers:** Special storage locations (like `EAX`, `EDX`) used to hold data temporarily.
- **The Stack:** A memory structure used to store variables, function arguments, and return addresses.

### 2. Types of CPU Instructions

- **Arithmetic Instructions:** e.g., `SUB` (subtract).
- **Data Movement Instructions:** e.g., `MOV` (move data between registers/memory).
- **Control Flow Instructions:** e.g., `JMP` (jump), `JNZ` (jump if not zero).

> **Note:** x86 is little-endian; instructions are written as `INSTRUCTION DESTINATION, SOURCE` (e.g., `MOV EDX, EAX` moves the value of `EAX` into `EDX`).

### 3. Stack Operations

- **PUSH:** Adds (pushes) data onto the stack (stack grows downward in memory).
- **POP:** Removes (pops) data from the stack, restoring previous state.

The stack is used to pass arguments to functions and store temporary data.

### 4. Function Calls and Returns

- **CALL:** Invokes a function (subroutine), saving the return address on the stack.
- **RET:** Returns from a function, restoring execution to the saved address.

#### Metaphor: Nested Function Calls

Think of the `main` function as your main task. If you call another function (e.g., `pickUpEggs`), you push its arguments onto the stack. If you get interrupted (e.g., need to `saveCatFromTree`), you call another function, pushing more data onto the stack. When done, you return to the previous function, using the stack to remember where you left off.

- The **base pointer** (`EBP`) helps keep track of where each function's stack frame begins, so you can always return to the right place.

## Memory Registers: The CPU's Read Heads

Think of memory registers like the read head of a VCR tape: as data streams by, the read head (register) grabs and processes the information needed at that moment. In x86 assembly, several key registers play specific roles:

- **EAX**: Accumulator register (general-purpose, often used for arithmetic and function return values)
- **EDX**: Data register (used for I/O operations and arithmetic)
- **EBX**: Base register (often used to point to data in memory)
- **ESP**: Stack pointer (tracks the top of the stack)
- **EBP**: Base pointer (marks the start of the current stack frame)
- **EIP**: Instruction pointer (points to the next instruction to execute)
- **ESI**: Source index (commonly used as a source pointer for string/array operations)
- **EDI**: Destination index (commonly used as a destination pointer for string/array operations)


At any time, these registers hold addresses, values, or pointers that facilitate the interaction between CPU instructions and the stack. They are essential for moving data, controlling program flow, and managing function calls.

**Pattern Recognition is Key**

Learning assembly and low-level execution is all about building pattern recognition. The more you work with these concepts, the more familiar the patterns become—making it easier to analyze and understand new binaries in the future.

### Reading a real main() prologue and a simple API call (cleaned explanation)

The assembly that comes out of a compiler can look cryptic at first, especially if you don't write C regularly. A few practical conventions appear everywhere — once you know them, the code becomes much easier to follow.

- argc / argv: In C the program's `main` function is commonly declared as `int main(int argc, char **argv)`. `argc` is the argument count (how many strings were passed on the command line). `argv` is an array of pointers to the argument strings themselves. If a program expects `source` and `destination` arguments, `argc` would be 2 and `argv` would point to those two strings. When you see these in assembly, they are simply values passed into `main` by the runtime.

- Function prologue: Almost every non-leaf function starts with the same setup: `push ebp`; `mov ebp, esp`. This sequence saves the caller's base pointer on the stack and sets the current base pointer to the current stack pointer — establishing a stable stack frame for local variables and arguments. Seeing this pattern tells you: “we're in a function and local variables/arguments will be referenced relative to `ebp`.”

- Using the stack for arguments (LIFO): On x86 with the stdcall/cdecl-style calling conventions, arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order (last argument pushed first). Because the stack is LIFO (last-in, first-out), the callee reads arguments in the correct order from its stack frame. When you see `push 0`, `push 0`, `push 0`, `push 0`, `push offset userAgentString` followed by `call ds:InternetOpenW`, you can map the pushed values to the documented parameters of `InternetOpenW` — user-agent, access type, proxy, proxy-bypass, flags — and verify the amount and order of arguments match the API's signature.

- Matching pushes to an API: A helpful trick is to count pushes immediately before a `call` and compare them to the documented number of parameters for that API. If they match and one of the pushed values is a pointer to a readable string (like `"Mozilla/5.0"`), you can be confident how the parameters line up.

- Return values and conditional flow: Many Windows API calls return status values in `EAX`. A common pattern is `test eax, eax` (or `cmp eax, 0`) followed by a conditional jump such as `jne` (jump if not equal) or `jz`/`jnz`. This is how the program checks success or failure and branches accordingly (e.g., execute the downloaded file vs. self-delete).

- Stepping into deeper functions: Cutter lets you step into a called function (double-click the target or use the debugger). If the called function dives into more complexity than you need for a high-level understanding, you can note its purpose (for example: construct file path or perform logging) and continue analyzing the main flow. Save deeper dives for when you need to confirm specifics.

This concrete pattern — function prologue, pushes for API params (in reverse order), `call`, then `test eax; jne` — is very common in networked droppers. Once you know to look for it, you'll spot download-and-execute logic quickly.

### Advanced Dynamic Analysis: Debugging Malware 

![x86](assets/img/debuger.png)

 A debugger sits between the running program and the OS, giving you precise control over each instruction the program executes. Unlike double-clicking a program to run it normally, a debugger lets you pause at the entry point, watch register and stack state (EIP, EAX, ESP, etc.), set breakpoints, and step through code instruction-by-instruction. Common controls are:

- F9 — Run (resume execution until the next breakpoint or the program exits)
- F8 — Step over (execute a call instruction without descending into it)
- F7 — Step into (descend into a called function and trace its instructions)
- F2 — Toggle breakpoint (pause execution when EIP reaches this instruction)

Keep in mind the debugger is mostly a one-way tool: you can advance forward and restart to return to earlier points, but you generally cannot step backwards through executed instructions. Use breakpoints and stepping selectively to map program behavior while watching registers, the stack, and memory for changes.

Practical debugging workflow: the point of using a debugger is to find the most interesting calling points (for example: networking, file I/O, process creation, or suspicious API calls), set breakpoints at those instructions, and then step into them to inspect arguments, return values, and side effects. Typical targets for breakpoints in droppers include `InternetOpen[AW]`, `URLDownloadToFile[AW]`, `CreateProcess`, `DeleteFile`, and functions that construct file paths or change persistence. This focused approach helps you get to the meaningful behavior quickly without stepping through every low-level instruction.


## The Offensive Potential of HTML

HTAs are commonly used as the payload of phishing attacks. 

![hta](assets/img/HTA.png)

It is no secret that HTML can be weaponized. Every time you visit a website, your web browser downloads and renders the code that is served out by that website. Your browser is really just an interpreter for the technologies that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML provides the structure of the website. CSS applies color, fonts, presentation, and layouts of the website. And JavaScript can dynamically control behavior of elements of the website.

It’s that last one that we need to watch out for.
JavaScript Is Dangerous

You may be familiar with the classic Cross-Site Scripting test that pops an alert box by injecting the `<script> block into an HTML page. If you’ve seen this test before, you may have wondered “what is actually going on when this happens?”`

![cros](assets/img/cross.png)

## JavaScript in HTML — a short demo

HTML pages can define the `<script>` tag to include code that can run different scripting languages. In most cases, the language is JavaScript. JavaScript can execute code within the browser to move components around on the page, change colors and fonts, pop that alert box, and do many other functions. Think of JavaScript as the programmatic engine of HTML.

The W3Schools demo for JavaScript’s `alert()` box method demonstrates this well.

Try saving this code to `index.html` and running it locally by opening it in a web browser:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>

    <h1>The Window Object</h1>
    <h2>The alert() Method</h2>

    <p>Click the button to display an alert box.</p>

    <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

    <script>
      function myFunction() {
        alert("Hello! I am an alert box!");
      }
    </script>

  </body>
</html>
```

Security note: running local HTML with JavaScript is safe for simple demos, but real-world web pages can include external scripts, track users, and attempt to exploit browser vulnerabilities. Never run untrusted HTML/JS in an environment with sensitive data or elevated privileges.
 
### Takeaway

The takeaway here is that JavaScript executes code within the browser. But when JavaScript executes within a web browser, the code execution is confined to the web browser itself. That is to say, the code runs in the context of the browser, manipulates the document model of the web page, and can manipulate cookies, but can’t reach the operating system of the host unless there is some kind of browser-based code execution vulnerability.

When used in an offensive capacity, JavaScript can perform activities like hooking the client’s browser (see the `BeEF Framework` for an example) and downloading files via `HTML Smuggling`. The offensive potential of JavaScript is apparent, but if it’s usually limited to the browser of the victim, then that doesn’t sound so bad, right?


### Enter: HTML Applications (HTA)

Imagine that a developer needs to design a compact, portable HTML site that can be easily sent to anyone who needs it. Maybe it’s a company survey. Maybe it’s a presentation of some sort. The developer can create an HTML Application (HTA) file for this purpose.

HTAs are Windows-executable, packaged HTML files that run HTML, CSS, and Windows native scripting languages from a single file outside of the context of the web browser. The last part of that sentence is the really scary thing here: HTAs do not run in the context of the Windows web browser, but instead run as a trusted application on the operating system.

An HTML Application is not much different from a normal HTML page in terms of construction. In fact, you can use the exact same code from an HTML page to make an HTA. That small change in packaging — running as an executable with wider privileges — is what makes HTAs attractive to attackers and dangerous for defenders.

Security note: treat HTA files like executables. Do not open HTAs from untrusted sources, and block or inspect them in email and file-transfer controls where possible.
